/**
 * @file Unified runtime adapter — detects runtime and installs the transform
 *
 * Domain context
 * --------------
 * This is the single file the rest of the library calls when it wants the
 * source-transform hook up and running. It hides the fact that different
 * runtimes need different installation mechanisms (CJS Module._extensions,
 * Node-ESM module.register(), Bun.plugin()) behind a single idempotent
 * `register()` function.
 *
 * Responsibility split
 * --------------------
 *   - CJS install (Node-CJS + Bun-CJS via Module._extensions) is done
 *     *in this file* because it can safely happen from within user-code
 *     evaluation: the CJS loader consults `Module._extensions` on every
 *     `require()` call, so a mid-evaluation install covers everything
 *     loaded afterward.
 *   - ESM install (Node-ESM + Bun-ESM) CANNOT happen from here because
 *     ESM's graph-before-evaluation ordering makes an in-process install
 *     too late to transform siblings. ESM install is done by the
 *     `register.mjs` preload entry at the repo root, which is loaded via
 *     `--import scribbles/register` (Node) or `bunfig.toml preload` (Bun).
 *     When that preload runs, it sets a cross-realm flag that THIS file
 *     checks; absence of the flag in an ESM-detected context triggers the
 *     one-per-boot warning.
 *
 * Technical context
 * -----------------
 * - Idempotency is managed via `install-flag.js`: repeated calls on any
 *   runtime are free, which matters because `index.js` calls register()
 *   on every `require('scribbles')` and the preload also calls it.
 * - Runtime detection for the warning path is heuristic: we check
 *   `process.argv[1]` for a `.mjs` extension, which catches the most
 *   common Node-ESM and Bun-ESM entry shapes without needing to read the
 *   user's `package.json` or inspect `import.meta`. False negatives (user
 *   runs `.js` in a `type:"module"` package) leave the warning silent,
 *   which is acceptable for an MVP; false positives would be a regression
 *   and do not happen with this heuristic.
 * - The v1.7.0 D11 bug fix lives here too: prior to v2, the CJS hook was
 *   never installed automatically; the feature only worked for callers
 *   who manually required `src/parsing/loader`. Calling `register()` from
 *   `index.js` on library load — which this file enables — makes the
 *   feature work out-of-the-box.
 *
 * `register.status()` / `register.assert()` (T6)
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * The `register` function also exposes two small introspection helpers
 * as methods on itself. They are intended for CI-boot assertions and for
 * programmatic "have you wired preload correctly?" checks. See their own
 * JSDoc blocks below for the contract.

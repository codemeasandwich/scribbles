/**
 * @file CJS source-transformation hook installer (inlined from node-hook)
 *
 * Domain context
 * --------------
 * For CommonJS loads — `require('./lib.js')` and friends — Scribbles installs
 * a transform on Node's `Module._extensions['.js']` handler. Any file loaded
 * after install has its source piped through `transformSource` (from
 * `src/parsing/transform.js`) before being compiled and evaluated. This is
 * the mechanism that rewrites `scribbles.log(user.name)` to
 * `scribbles.log.at({...}, "hello", user.name)` so the runtime can emit
 * `user.name:<value>` in its output.
 *
 * Historically Scribbles consumed the `node-hook` npm package for this. In
 * v2 we inline the ~25 LOC of logic we actually used, dropping the
 * dependency entirely (honouring CASE's zero-runtime-deps rule) and gaining
 * explicit control over the hook chain's semantics. The behaviour mirrors
 * node-hook's "nested transforms" model: each `install(fn)` call stacks
 * another transform on top of the previously-registered ones for the same
 * extension, and they run in registration order with each transform's
 * string output feeding the next.
 *
 * Bun compatibility: delegating the fast path
 * -------------------------------------------
 * On Bun, replacing `Module._extensions['.js']` with a handler that does
 * `fs.readFileSync + module._compile` can corrupt Bun's in-progress CJS
 * wrapper state when `require('scribbles')` is called from a module that
 * is itself still being loaded by a parent's require(). Symptom (reported
 * by an integrator running api-ape's deepRequire pipeline on Bun 1.3.10):
 *
 *     error: Expected CommonJS module to have a function wrapper.
 *     If you weren't messing around with Bun's internals, this is a bug
 *     in Bun
 *
 * The workaround — and the shape this file now implements — is to keep a
 * reference to the ORIGINAL handler and delegate to it for every file
 * that has no `scribbles.<level>(...)` call sites. The transform's
 * fast-path already relies on that substring check internally (see
 * `src/parsing/transform.js`: "if the substring `scribbles.` is not
 * present on this line, there is nothing to rewrite"), so skipping the
 * `fs.readFileSync + module._compile` round-trip when NO line matches
 * costs nothing at runtime while preserving Bun's native compile
 * pipeline for ~99% of user code. Files that DO use scribbles still
 * flow through our transform path; the small fraction of modules that
 * contain `scribbles.<level>(...)` in their top-level scope were not the
 * ones observed to trigger the wrapper bug in the integrator's reports.
 *
 * Technical context
 * -----------------
 * - `Module._extensions['.js']` is Node's legacy-but-stable public extension
 *   point for CJS source loading. Bun implements the same object with the
 *   same contract (verified empirically — Bun 1.3 exposes it for .js, .cjs,
 *   .mjs, .ts, .tsx, .mts, .cts).
 * - ESM loads (`import './lib.mjs'`) bypass this hook completely. For ESM a
 *   separate installer using `module.register()` (Node) / `Bun.plugin()`
 *   (Bun) is wired from the `register.mjs` preload entry.
 * - The stack-of-transforms map lives on globalThis (same protocol as
 *   `install-flag.js`) so two independently-bundled copies of Scribbles
 *   cooperatively share the hook chain instead of clobbering each other.
 * - The extension handler calls `module._compile(source, filename)` — an
 *   internal API — because that is the *only* way to return transformed
 *   source to Node's CJS loader from an extension handler. This mirrors
 *   how node-hook, istanbul, ts-node, and @swc/register all do it.
 *
 * Call shape
 * ----------
 *   install(transformFn)
 *     // transformFn :: (source: string, filename: string) => string
 *     // Registers transformFn for the default extensions ['.js', '.cjs'].
 *     // Both extensions are hooked because real-world CJS codebases mix
 *     // them freely.

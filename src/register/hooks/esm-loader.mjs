/**
 * @file Node ESM loader worker for Scribbles source transformation
 *
 * Domain context
 * --------------
 * ESM modules in Node are parsed and linked before any user code evaluates,
 * which means a source transform must be registered via Node's loader API
 * *before* the main module graph is constructed. This file is the "worker"
 * half of that loader — it runs in a separate thread when installed via
 * `module.register('./src/register/hooks/esm-loader.mjs', parentUrl)` and
 * exports the hooks (`load`, optionally `resolve`) that Node calls for
 * every module request in the main graph.
 *
 * Each `.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` / `.ts` / etc. file that the worker sees
 * has its source piped through the same `transformSource` function that
 * the CJS loader uses, so Node-ESM users get byte-identical logging output
 * to Node-CJS users for the same call sites.
 *
 * Technical context
 * -----------------
 * - The filename extension is `.mjs` (not `.js`) because Scribbles'
 *   `package.json` declares `"type": "commonjs"`, which makes `.js`
 *   files CJS by default. A loader worker has to be native ESM (it uses
 *   top-level `import` statements and exports `load` / `resolve` named
 *   hooks), so the file extension overrides the package-level default.
 * - Written as an ESM module because `module.register()` expects its
 *   worker URL to resolve to one. `import.meta.url` is consulted at
 *   load time so we can resolve sibling modules via relative paths.
 * - `createRequire(import.meta.url)` is used to import the CJS transform
 *   module (`src/parsing/transform.js`). This avoids duplicating the
 *   transform implementation in ESM form — there is exactly one
 *   `transformSource` function in the whole package.
 * - Only file:// URLs with matching extensions are transformed; everything
 *   else (core modules, http:// imports, data: URLs, etc.) is passed
 *   through to the next loader unchanged. This matches the principle of
 *   least surprise and lets Scribbles coexist with other ESM loader hooks.
 * - Extensions include `.ts` / `.cts` / `.mts` / `.tsx` for toolchains that
 *   hand Node pre-transpiled or directly-executable TypeScript. The
 *   transform is a string-level rewrite of `scribbles.<level>(...)` calls
 *   that works identically on JS and TS syntax, so there is no reason to
 *   refuse TS inputs.

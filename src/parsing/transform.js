/**
 * @file Pure source-code transformer for Scribbles call sites
 *
 * Domain context
 * --------------
 * This is the heart of Scribbles' "automatic variable name extraction"
 * feature — the invisible machinery that makes `scribbles.log(user.name)`
 * emit `user.name:<value>` rather than just `<value>`. End users never see
 * this file and are *not* expected to write `.at(...)` calls by hand. Quoting
 * the project's design notes:
 *
 *   "The `.at(` is not intended to be used normally and is an escape hatch.
 *    As long as you use the word `scribbles` as your variable, there is a
 *    runtime source-code parser that dynamically replaces `scribbles.xxx`
 *    calls with an in-line `.at` in order to give accurate file and line
 *    numbers … It's intended that you will use `scribbles.log`, `scribbles.error`
 *    etc., and scribbles will look for this marker and automatically inject
 *    the correct location information."
 *
 * This transformer is the thing that does that replacement. Given the raw
 * source text of a JS/TS file, it rewrites every `scribbles.<level>(args...)`
 * call so that the runtime receives both the original arguments AND a packet
 * of lazy metadata describing the call site:
 *
 *   before:  scribbles.log("hello", user.name, err)
 *   after:   scribbles.log.at(
 *              { file:"/app/lib.js", line:17, col:4,
 *                args:[false, x=>x`user.name`, x=>x`err`] },
 *              "hello", user.name, err
 *            )
 *
 * The `.at(...)` method is installed on each level at config time by
 * `src/core/scribblesConfig.js` — it accepts the metadata as its first arg
 * and then delegates to the regular `scribble(...)` function. The lazy
 * `x=>x\`user.name\`` thunks are evaluated later in the caller's lexical
 * scope (where `user` is defined), which is the *only* way to resolve the
 * value of `user.name` after the call site has been rewritten. Without this
 * in-scope closure, a post-hoc source-parsing approach could recover the
 * *name* `"user.name"` but never its runtime *value* — which is why a
 * compile/load-time transform is the only mechanism that preserves full
 * feature parity.
 *
 * Technical context
 * -----------------
 * - Extracted from the pre-v2 `src/parsing/loader.js` during the multi-runtime
 *   refactor so this transformation can be reused verbatim by every loader
 *   adapter (Node-CJS `Module._extensions`, Node-ESM `module.register()`,
 *   Bun's `Bun.plugin`, and future bundler plugins). The function is pure —
 *   no I/O, no module globals mutated, no runtime assumptions — which lets
 *   each adapter own its own side-effects while sharing the algorithm.
 * - The transform is line-based: it splits on `\n` and processes one line at
 *   a time, handing each line to a lookahead character pump that is allowed
 *   to cross line boundaries for multi-line calls. This matches how the
 *   pre-v2 loader worked and preserves identical output for the existing
 *   test corpus (a non-negotiable T2 constraint).
 * - The list of recognized levels comes from `config.levels` plus the
 *   reserved `status` level. When users register custom levels via
 *   `scribbles.config({ levels: [...] })`, those names take effect for any
 *   file transformed AFTER the config call. The reserved logging variants
 *   `timer` / `timerEnd` / `group*` are injected via the same `.at` mechanism
 *   by `scribblesConfig.js` and do not need to appear in `levels2check` here.
 * - Filenames are normalised to start with `/` relative to `appDir` so the
 *   emitted `file:"..."` string is stable across machines and invocation cwd.
 *   When the filename starts outside `appDir` (e.g. a file from a dependency
 *   that happens to also use Scribbles), the raw filename is prefixed with
 *   `/` so runtime stack frames still look reasonable.

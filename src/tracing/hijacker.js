/**
 * @file HTTP/HTTPS request hijacker for automatic trace header injection
 *
 * Domain context
 * --------------
 * When a user opts into outbound header propagation via
 * `scribbles.config({ headers: [...] })` or `headersMapping`, Scribbles
 * wraps Node's `http.request` / `https.request` so that every outgoing
 * request gets the W3C traceparent / tracestate plus any configured
 * forwarded headers injected on the way out. This is the glue that
 * makes distributed tracing work seamlessly across microservices
 * without the caller having to thread headers by hand.
 *
 * Idempotent install + the "stale-wrapper" bug it prevents
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Prior to v2.0.0 this file captured the original request function at
 * MODULE EVAL time:
 *
 *     const reqHttp = http.request.bind(http);
 *
 * That was fine on a clean Node process, but Jest's per-test-file module
 * reset re-evaluates this file for every test file. By the time the
 * SECOND file's evaluation happens, `http.request` has already been
 * replaced with v1's wrapper from the FIRST boot — so `reqHttp` captured
 * a wrapper, not the native function. When the new wrapper's early-
 * return path called `originalRequest(...)` it therefore ran the OLD
 * wrapper, which closed over the OLD `config` reference (still holding
 * truthy `headers` from the first file) and injected a malformed
 * `traceparent: "00-undefined-undefined-01"` header on requests that
 * should have passed through untouched. The symptom was a flaky
 * `__tests__/32-hijacker-http-request.test.js` suite that only failed
 * when run alongside other test files.
 *
 * The fix below stores the true native request function on the `http` /
 * `https` modules themselves, keyed by `Symbol.for(...)`. The http/https
 * core modules are NOT reset by Jest, so the stored original survives
 * module reloads. Every subsequent hijacker() call rewraps the same
 * native original, no matter how many times the hijacker module has
 * been re-evaluated.
 *
 * Technical context
 * -----------------
 * - `Symbol.for(...)` is used rather than a private Symbol so the key
 *   survives realm/duplicate-module edge cases (the hijacker module
 *   being loaded from two separate `node_modules/scribbles` copies,
 *   for example — rare, but not impossible in monorepos). All Scribbles
 *   registry symbols follow this `scribbles.<purpose>` naming scheme.
 * - The per-wrapper `WRAPPER_MARKER` flag is informational: it lets
 *   test infrastructure or health checks detect that a function IS
 *   our wrapper rather than a native or third-party interceptor,
 *   without relying on `.toString()` inspection.
 * - The passthrough check `!config.headers && !config.headersMapping`
 *   is evaluated on EACH request call (late binding), so toggling the
 *   config at runtime takes effect immediately with no re-install.

// ever loaded. That branch is unreachable from the public interface:
// this `if` guard only runs on the first Scribbles boot in the process,
// and on the first boot `http.request` is the native function (no
// wrapper marker present) because Scribbles is the only codepath that
// stamps `WRAPPER_MARKER`. Removed per the dead-code rule; the commit
// preserving the context is recorded in git history. Should a real
// scenario ever require walking a pre-existing wrapper chain, the
// resurrection is a few lines and can cite the history.
